# Contributing Guidelines
Firstly, thank you for contributing to this project. It means a lot to us. These guidelines are generally meant for contrributors who are new to open source. However, even if you are an experienced contributor to open source projects, you should still read these guidelines.

Before you get started, you must read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/allisto/allisto-app/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and make sure you follow it. You also agree to our [License](https://github.com/allisto/allisto-app/blob/master/LICENSE) and any changes you make will be licensed under those terms unless other terms have been specifically agreed upon beforehand. 

## Important
Do not report critical security flaws which can affect user security through GitHub. Instead, email us at projectallisto@gmail.com or personally contact one of the team members.

## Found a bug? Let us know
1. Firstly, go to [the Issues page](https://github.com/allisto/allisto-app/issues) to see if the issue has not already been opened. You can use the search tool there to search for your issue. If you find a similar or related open issue, consider commenting on the issue if you are also facing the issue and/or have additional information which can help us debug and fix the issue.
1. If you don't find a similar issue, consider opening a new issue. When you choose to create a new issue, you will have the option to use a [template](https://github.com/allisto/allisto-app/issues/new/choose). Consider using the bug report template to report your issue.
1. Follow the template and provide as much relevant information as you can. These include debug logs, your device details (such as phone model and version), app version etc. Include steps to reproduce the issue if possible.
1. (optional) If the issue is really important, consider leaving a message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/allisto/community) so that we can look into it faster.
1. Make sure you give your issue a simple and descriptive title and then press Submit new issue to submit the issue.
1. Follow the issue page for any updates or additional information we may ask you for. Consider adding relevant tags.

1. Fork the repository in your own account and make changes there.
