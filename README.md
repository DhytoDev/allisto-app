Allisto mobile app is an essential part of [Project Allisto](https://github.com/allisto) and connects seemlessly with other services to provide the primary interface for users to benefit from the project. Currently, it allows users to record and send audio to the servers for analysis.

## Getting Started

- Download the source code (or clone this repository)
- Extract/copy the files in a directory of your choice.
- Run the commands flutter packages get and flutter packages upgrade
- Connect a device and use the command flutter run to run the app on your device!
Use the app and let us know if we could improve it in any way
